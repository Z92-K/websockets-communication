Check [React-native](https://reactnative.dev) documentation for a ` How to build Basic App` and [Using Sockets with React-native](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44088058/proper-way-of-using-websockets-with-react-native)

# Websockets-communication challenge
 
 In this tutorial I am going to be using Expo to build a React-native app for iOS, Android,
 and web that allows the server to listen for events of type "textMessage", with a "text" in the payload, and then broadcast the received message to all websocket clientsmessaging ! 

 To make it more fun and ensure that what you're building works on the web and phone install Expo client app on your iOS/Android mobile

To run :

```
Expo start
```

To test on mobile apps: 

```
Scan QR code from the terminal on your device and follow instructions 
```
